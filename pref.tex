{A few months ago, on his last visit to New Jersey, I was telling [Paul] Erd\H{o}s something about $p$-adic analysis. Erd\H{o}s was not interested. ``You know,'' he said about the $p$-adic numbers, ``they donâ€™t really exist.''}{Melvyn Nathanson}

    {In the long history of mathematics, `number' has always meant real number, and it is only relatively recently that we have become aware of the world of $p$-adic numbers.

$p$-adic numbers were birthed into the world by Kurt Hensel in 1897, at a lecture for the annual meeting of the 
German Mathematical Society. Initially, these new objects were viewed with some skepticism. Helmut Hasse recollects that in 1920, no less a figure than Richard Courant advised him against studying with Hensel, dismissing Hensel's 1913 book on $p$-adic numbers as an unproductive detour (``unfruchtbarer Seitenweg''). Yet today $p$-adic numbers have thoroughly permeated number theory. Local-global principles, which relate solubility in number fields to solubility in $p$-adic fields, are central to modern arithmetic geometry.
Tate's thesis and the adelic viewpoint on class field theory are bread and butter to algebraic number theorists. And those on the analytic side of the fence can point to `local densities' as $p$-adically motivated objects that arise in nearly every study of arithmetic counting problems. We live in an age when activists and arithmeticians universally agree on the need to think (and act) both globally and locally. 

These problem sets, written for a topics course at the 2024 Ross Indiana summer mathematics camp, do not describe any of these significant modern applications of $p$-adic numbers. Rather, they offer a hands-on --- better, \emph{minds-on}! --- approach to the foundational theory of $\Q_p$, working towards elementary but attractive number-theoretic applications. Whenever there was a choice to be made, I have elected to treat special cases rather than develop general theory. This has allowed prerequisites to be kept to a minimum. Readers are expected to have seen number theory and rigorous calculus, as well as both abstract and matrix algebra, but most of what is needed belongs to the standard undergraduate curriculum.

Notwithstanding the chosen title, these problem sets aim to offer a general introduction to $p$-adic numbers, privileging neither analysis nor algebra. Analysts will be disappointed by the absence of material on continuity, differentiability, and $p$-adic interpolation. Algebraists will be disheartened that the discussion never ventures beyond $\Q_p$ to any of its finite or infinite extensions. Despite the many omissions, I am optimistic that as individuals engage with these problem sets, they will catch a glimpse of an alluring territory begging to be charted. The suggested readings listed below have been selected as particularly approachable, and we commend their consideration to those with an adventurous spirit.

\subsection*{How to use this book}

This manuscript is intended as a resource for undergraduates and beginning graduate students looking to dip their toes into non-Archimedean waters.

For the teacher using the text as a resource for a class on $p$-adic numbers: First of all, congratulations! As you are probably aware, courses on this topic at the specified level are rare. 

If the book is used as the primary course text, problems should be distributed to students independently of solutions. Class time can be spent discussing ideas and approaches, with conversations led by students but facilitated by the instructor. Experts will often see more in the problems than beginning students and they are encouraged to use these discussions to share insights.

Solutions to Problem Set ($p$-Set) $X$ can be passed out once the class, as a whole (or at least, \emph{on} the whole), is ready to move on to Set $X+1$. For those on the semester system, a reasonable aim is to cover roughly one set per week, with the expectation that later material will take a bit more time. The book can also be used in a supplementary fashion, with an instructor handpicking interesting-seeming problems to spice up their own exercise sheets. 

For students: Congratulations to you as well! $p$-adic numbers are a(n) (un)real treat to think about. If you are using the book for a course, follow the directions of your instructor. If you are using the book for self-study, I strongly recommend working through the problems systematically, tackling one set completely before moving on to the next. Please give yourself enough time for the mental fermentation process to occur before giving up on a question! Of course, you should not feel bad if after a long struggle certain problems continue to elude you; solutions are included for precisely these moments. 

I should emphasize that this is not meant to be your only book on $p$-adic numbers. The author, for instance, learned about $p$-adic numbers from entirely different sources! After mastering the material on each problem set, it is recommended that you look at how the corresponding content is treated in the suggested references. One only truly understands a topic after examining it from all angles, and different texts bring out different perspectives.


\subsection*{Saying what we mean and meaning what we say} %Most of our notations and conventions will be familiar, with the remainder introduced as necessary. 
Exercises are typically introduced as assertions, without the use of ``show that'' or ``prove.'' (The \textsf{\pp s}, embedded in the solutions, are exceptions.) Problem solvers should recognize they are on the hook to validate every claim.

We take no position on the hotly contested issue of whether $0$ is a \textsf{natural number}. Integers greater than or equal to $0$ are --- naturally enough --- referred to as \textsf{nonnegative integers}. As is customary in English, \textsf{positive} means \emph{strictly} larger than zero. We write $\Z^{+}$, $\Q^{+}$, and $\R^{+}$ for the sets of positive integers, rational numbers, and real numbers, respectively.

Our terminology around quotient rings is slightly unconventional. To start with, the term \textsf{ring} always refers to a commutative ring with unity. If $I$ is an ideal of the ring $R$, and $a\in R$, the class of $a$ with respect to congruence modulo $I$ is typically denoted ``$a\bmod{I}$.'' We break this rule when (and only when) $R=\Z$ and $I=m\Z$, instead writing ``$a\bmod{m}$.'' Additionally, we use ``$\Z/m$'' in place of ``$\Z/m\Z$''; this is a mild concession to the notation $\Z_m$ appearing on the first-year Ross Program problem sets.

\subsection*{Acknowledgements}
Assembling these problem sets involved much scouring and borrowing. Deserving of particular mention:  Exercise \ref{ex:CC} was sourced from an article by Catherine Crompton in the Rose Hulman Undergrad.\ Mathematics Journal. Exercises \ref{ex:wilson00} and \ref{ex:wilson1} were inspired by discussions in Murty's text \cite{murty}. Exercise \ref{ex:pi} was taken from Koblitz's book \cite{koblitz}. The proof of Ramanujan's conjecture on integer solutions to $x^2+7=2^m$ follows closely the exposition in Cassels's monograph \cite{cassels86}. The proof ``from-the-Book'' of Skolem's theorem on integer linear recurrences, outlined on Set \#11, is due to Tao (loosely based on an argument of Georges Hansel):

This manuscript would not exist without the backing and encouragement of the Ross Mathematics Foundation. Site directors Timothy All and Jim Fowler have my profound appreciation for their inspiring efforts, year after year, to ensure that the Ross Program provides a supportive, welcoming, and stimulating environment for all camp participants (students, counselors, and even us lecturers!). Special thanks to Phoebe Watkins for her service as course assistant, Paco Adajar for suggesting the term ``$p$-set'' as an alternative to the more mundane ``problem set,'' and Jacob Bucciarelli for sharing his expertise in orbital mechanics.
